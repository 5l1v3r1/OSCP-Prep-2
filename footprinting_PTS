To identify running hosts and map a network 

> fping -a -g IPRANGE
> fping -a -g 10.54.12.0/24
> fping -a -g 10.54.12.0 10.54.12.255

-a forces the tool to show only alive hosts
-g tells the toole that we want to perform a ping sweep instead of standard ping

- When running Fping on Lan you're directly attached to, even if yo use the (-a) option, you will get some warning messages \\
  (ICMP Host Unreachabke) about offline hosts. To supress those messages you can redirect the process standard error to /dev/null

> fping -a -g 192.168.82.0 192.168.82.255 2>/dev/null
