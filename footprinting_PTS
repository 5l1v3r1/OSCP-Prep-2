To identify running hosts and map a network 

> fping -a -g IPRANGE
> fping -a -g 10.54.12.0/24
> fping -a -g 10.54.12.0 10.54.12.255

-a forces the tool to show only alive hosts
-g tells the toole that we want to perform a ping sweep instead of standard ping

- When running Fping on Lan you're directly attached to, even if yo use the (-a) option, you will get some warning messages \\
  (ICMP Host Unreachabke) about offline hosts. To supress those messages you can redirect the process standard error to /dev/null

> fping -a -g 192.168.82.0 192.168.82.255 2>/dev/null 



- To perform a ping scan using (nmap): 
> nmap -sn 200.200.0.0/16
> nmap -sn 200.200.123.1-12 
> nmap -sn 172.16.12.* 
> nmap -sn 200.200.12-13.*

However, I can create a file called (hostslist.txt) containing the following IPs: 

200.200.0.0/16
200.200.123.1-12 
172.16.12.* 
200.200.12-13.*

Then perform the next command 
> nmap -sn -iL hostslist.txt 
-iL = input list 


Here's more way of discovering alive hosts in this link: https://nmap.org/book/man-host-discovery.html

>>>> Once we mapped the network, we end up with a list of live hosts. These are the hosts which responded to pings or nmap probes.

Determining which OS is the host running: 

To fingerpring an OS you have to send a network request and analyze the responses. 
1) Fingerprinting Tools send a series of specially crafted requests to the target host
2) Then start analysing every bit in the responses. 
3) Finally, the signature is compared against a database of known OS signatures.

@ Offline OS fingerprinting can be done with p0f here > http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/

> nmap -Pn -O <targets> 
-Pn = to skip the ping scan if you already know the target is up 
-O = Enable OS detection 
--osscan-limit = Limit OS detection to promising targets 
--osscan-guess = Guess OS more aggressively 

> nmap -O --osscan-limit <targets>            \\ Just get the promising ones. 

For more info about detecting OS look up here:  Remote OS Detection https://nmap.org/book/osdetect.html

Once network mapping is performed, we know which nodes are alive, and associated OSs. 
Now we need a way to discover the daemons and services running on those nodes:

& PORT SCANNING: 
is a process to know what TCP and UDP ports are open on targets. Moreover, it lets you know which daemon, in terms of software and version 
is listing on specific port. Then using it to create a list of potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities
