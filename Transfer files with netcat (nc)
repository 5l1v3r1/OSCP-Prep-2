open a port on your local computer:



            nc -nlvp {port} > {name of the file}
          
            for me it was :

            nc -nlvp 4444 > incoming.exe


from a remote computer, connect to the opened port 

            nc -nv {ip} {port} < {file name}
            
            for me it was 
            
            
            nc -nv 192.168.230.128 4444 < /usr/share/widnwos
