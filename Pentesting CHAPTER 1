1- Internet information services (IIS) Web Server - Works on Windows.
Default Folder: "C:\Inetpub\wwwroot"


2- Apache Server - works on Lunux/Unix.
Default Folder: " /var/www/ "
Folders such as: 
/etc/shadow/ contains hashes for each users 
/use/lib contains executable files by shell scripts or users. 
/var/ contains files related to database, wepapp source, logs. 
/bin/ contains software which the system needs to run. >> binary /bin/

3- Web server is the hacker's target, cause it has open ports, vulnerabilities, missconfiguration, and
default settings.

4- HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP): used to interact & connect with the web server. **UNSECURE**

Using HTTP without the cookies, might ask you to re-logint in every step you make. 
So they created **SESSIOSN**, so the server keeps the directory of your requests after login.

5- Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS): 
when HTTP uses scure socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) then we get HTTPS.
Using HTTPS means a encrypted connection.

6- Cycles HTTPS:
REQUEST from the user's browser, and RESPONSE from the web server.
Browses sends a request contains Parameters, and the server sends back a response to the source's request.

WebApp depends on the PARAMETERS, so it's the first target for an attacker by using malicious parameters 
to exploit web server & web application.

7- HTTP Header:
each HTTP cycles has HTTP header. We'll focus on the Headers coming from the **WEB SERVER** and get 
sent to the USER's Browser.

a) Set-cookie: secure a sessions. so if a hacker stole a sessions cookiem he will use it.
b) Content-Length: length of the header in bytes, helps an attacker to decrypt the response by Brute Force.
c) Location: used when webapp redirect the user to new page. 
d) Cookie: sends cookie to keep the session alive. It's always the same as set-cookie header.
e) Referrer: displays the webpages a user has visited when the next requestin from the Web Server.

8- HTTP status codes:
as long as your browser receive a server response, it will contain a status code to point out the response type.

There are more 50 status code, and divided to 5 types:
- 100: means there's another response coming from the web server.
- 200: means a user's request was received & processed fine by the web server, and a responde will be sent.
- 300: means redirecting the user for extra response. 
- 400: means there's a mistake in the request by the user & can't be processed by the web server. (401 unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 not Found
- 500: it's a server side mistake (500 Internak Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable)
